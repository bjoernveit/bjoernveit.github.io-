# Björn Veit
Computersicentist and athlete, the perfect combination.


## About me
Hello there, my name is Björn Veit, I study computer sicence at the University of Bremen.

I will be done with my bachelor this summer and I'm looking to follow it up with a Master right a way. I'm also planning to fulfill the KIKR-Profile (Künstliche Intelligenz, Kognition und Robotik), within my masters degree.

Right now I'm and have been for the past 6 months, working on my bachelor-projekt called *Arico Approximate Computing*. A university-projekt, where I build arithmetic hardware with the capability to approximate the result, in a trade off for time. Now that I have spend a lot of time with building the actual hardware, I want to research how/if it can be used in machine learning. I will do this as my bachelorthesis.

In my free time I play Basketball for the *DTV Devils* in Delmenhorst. I also do a lot of body weight training, to become better player and athlete. I truely belive that beeing a computer sicentist and an athlete at the same time is a perfect combination. Going to your limits and beyond, will clear you head completely, which is most usefull, when your stuck with a problem of any kind. If you don't belive me just try it yourself, next time your stuck finding an error in your code and can't seem to wrap your head around it. Do an exhausting 30 min workout. You can find plenty you can do anywhere anytime on the internet (you can ask me, too). Afterwards you get a fresh start at takling the problem at hand. Obviously I can't garantee your success afterwards, but I'm sure you have a better chance of solving the problem this way, worst case you get more fit.
I know what you're thinking *"I can't just do a workout in the office"* and I guess you are right, just do something when you get home then. Your head will just be more clear in general and it brings great balance to the office/university life.

I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but I can't imagine my life without sports. I'm just saying pushing your limits and having exhausted your whole body completly is a great feeling for me, but you schould check it out for yourself.


## Body weight Training:

Why do I think beeing an athlete is a prefect combination to beeing a Computersicentist, you might ask.<br />

Well, going to your limits and beyond, will clear you head completely, which is most usefull, when your stuck with a problem of any kind. If you don't belive me just try it yourself, next time your stuck finding an error in your code and can't seem to wrap your head around it. Do an exhausting 30 min workout.

I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but I can't imagine my life without sports. I'm just saying pushing your limits and having exhausted your whole body completly is a great feeling for me, but you schould check it out for yourself. Since bodyweight workouts don't require a membership to anything you don't have any excuses anyway.

## University

I started studying Computersicence 2011 and am looking to graduate with my mastersdegree in the summer of 2019.<br />

Ever since I completed the required courses for the bachelor, I started to orient mostly in the direction of machine learning und artificial intelligenz. I'm a very logic driven person, so I like the idea of algorithms beeing able to performe smart actions, even thought their based on simple logic.<br />

Right now I'm and have been for the past 4 months, working on my bachelor-projekt called <em>Arico Approximate Computing</em>. A university-projekt, where I build arithmetic hardware with the capability to approximate the result, in a trade off for time. Now that I have spend a lot of time with building the actual hardware, I want to research how/if it can be used in machine learning. I will do this as my bachelorthesis.

## Local hack day

The Local Hack Day, is a national MLH event, where all over the world small local 12h Hackdays took place at the same time. One of which I organized with 3 fellow students. At hackdays like these you meet new people, learn new stuff and simply use the great work athmosphere to work on your own projects. Last year one of our sponsors (<a href="www.ubimax.de">UBiMAX</a>), brought to two Microsof Hololenses to the event. <br />

If I sparked your intresst, I'm sorry the event took place last december. I know its still a long way to go, but we are defenetly looking to orginize an other one at the end of this year.

## Chess

## Basketball
Basketball is by far my most passionate hobby. I love that Basketball is such a high paste, action packed game. It makes it fun to watch, as well as always leaving a window open for a comeback. For me the high paste brings up a completely diffrent aspect to the game, when playing you have to make fast decision, where you don't have time to overthink. I find this really refreshing, since I'm usually the kind of guy who always thinks about everything a little to much. <br />
I play Basketball for the <em>DTV Devils</em> in Delmenhorst. We managed to become third in the Oberliga-West this year. If you want to know more check out the teams website.
