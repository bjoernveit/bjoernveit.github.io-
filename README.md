Computersicentist and athlete, the perfect combination.


## About me 
Hello there, my name is Björn Veit, I study computer sicence at the University of Bremen.

I will be done with my bachelor this summer and I'm looking to follow it up with a Master right a way. I'm also planning to fulfill the KIKR-Profile (Künstliche Intelligenz, Kognition und Robotik), within my masters degree.

Right now I'm and have been for the past 6 months, working on my bachelor-projekt called *Arico Approximate Computing*. A university-projekt, where I build arithmetic hardware with the capability to approximate the result, in a trade off for time. Now that I have spend a lot of time with building the actual hardware, I want to research how/if it can be used in machine learning. I will do this as my bachelorthesis.

In my free time I play Basketball for the *DTV Devils* in Delmenhorst. I also do a lot of body weight training, to become better player and athlete. I truely belive that beeing a computer sicentist and an athlete at the same time is a perfect combination. Going to your limits and beyond, will clear you head completely, which is most usefull, when your stuck with a problem of any kind. If you don't belive me just try it yourself, next time your stuck finding an error in your code and can't seem to wrap your head around it. Do an exhausting 30 min workout. You can find plenty you can do anywhere anytime on the internet (you can ask me, too). Afterwards you get a fresh start at takling the problem at hand. Obviously I can't garantee your success afterwards, but I'm sure you have a better chance of solving the problem this way, worst case you get more fit.
I know what you're thinking *"I can't just do a workout in the office"* and I guess you are right, just do something when you get home then. Your head will just be more clear in general and it brings great balance to the office/university life. 

I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but I can't imagine my life without sports. I'm just saying pushing your limits and having exhausted your whole body completly is a great feeling for me, but you schould check it out for yourself.
